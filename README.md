# Approach
This was a day project built as an assessment from my internship interview with Edusko. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for features.

Originally I wanted to build an web page that display the epic photos taken by the Curiosity Mars Rover that gives users ability to click on a rover to learn more about it origin, I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then using axios to fetch data

One of the main challenges I ran into was mapping through nexted object and rendering the fetched data to a different page. This lead me to spend the weekend trying to resolve this. Due to project time constraints
